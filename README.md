# SeleniumTest
A quick way to get a look at someone's approach to writing Selenium code.

This uses JUnit and contains all of the code needed to run with either IntelliJ or Maven.


# Instructions
* Spend no more than 2 hours on this exercise
* Clone this repository onto your local computer
* Implement the instructions in the comments
    * Add your name to the String variables
    * Implement the Create, Read, Update & Delete actions
    * Update the code to run it on Sauce Labs
    * Fill out as many fields in the form as you have time for on the Create
* If you have time, feel free to optimize the code or abstract things in a way that makes sense to you 
* Commit your changes
* Provide Answers by email:
    * Use git format-patch HEAD to store your commits (use HEAD~ for 2 commits, HEAD~~ for 3, etc)
    * Provide the patch file(s) to the person who pointed you to this project (or me: titusfortner@gmail.com).
    * Include in your email the things you would do to improve your code and the abstractions that
would make it more maintainable.
